=== ASSIGNMENT ===
Go through the "Intro to HTML/CSS: Making Webpages" course.

If you get frustrated and want to stop then do it. Write down any questions
you have and I'll answer them later.

You should also be developing typing skills along with your coding skills.
You can also go through the other tab - "Typing Jungle" - to practice
typing skills.

=== NOTES #1 ===
To apply changes you made to your website follow these steps:
1) Save the file:
  Look at top bar > CLICK File > Save
2) Stage the changes you made:
  Look at the "Git" Toolbar on the right of this page > CLICK "Stage All"
3) Commit your changes:
  Under the Stage box, you can see a "commit message" box where you will have
  to type in a short description of the change you made. After you type the message,
  press the blue "Commit to master" button.
4) Push changes to the "master" branch:
  Look for a "Push 1" that will pop up next to the word "master" on the bottom bar.
  Click on "Push 1" and it will push your code to a place the website can reach
  to update itself. Wait about a minute and you should see your changes on the actual site.
